=================================
export
 - To mount Glue and HANS data per author instructions. This is needed for training the base models.
   Trained (fined tuned) base models are used during experiments.
  
faiss_index
 - To store all generated faiss indices (needed for running experiments).
  
logs
 - Logging output from sbatch runs. Useful for debugging and estimating time needed for a run.
  
mnli_retrain_influence
 - Needed for running experiments.
   
runs
 - Autologging from running HF.
    
tmp-output
 -  CURRENTLY EMPTY - Why does it exist?

tuned_param
 - Trained (fined-tuned) model params are saved here.
 
zbash_files_sbatch
 - Saves all the bash files used to train base models and run experiments.
 
==================================
create_FAISS_index.ipynb
 - Used to create faiss indices
 
MainTest.ipynb
 - Acts as a sandbox to test if codes run properly before running using sbatch
 
zNotes_added_filesFolders
 - Notes files and folders added, and the reason of it.

SelfCodes.ipynb
 - To test codes written by myself
 
self_codes.py
 - Codes written by Thean. Some are used to replicate experiment results.
 - Utilities functions
 
recall_at_m.py
 - Codes by Thean. To calculate and plot recall@m
