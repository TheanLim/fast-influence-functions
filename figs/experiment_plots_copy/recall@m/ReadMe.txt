This is not entirely like what the author did because they use the first 50 test cases for each correct and incorrect prediction.
I am:
 - using 52 correct and 48 incorrect
 - not the first 50 test cases because we want to fit the running time under 8 hours.
 
Next:
- It's best if I could run everything more than 8 hours. everything will straight forward.
- Might need to rerun everything again in order to "replicate" the author.
